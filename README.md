# 🇫🇷 A French Guy in the Netherlands 🇳🇱

This repository hosts a personal website I created as part of my academic program at [ESEO](https://www.eseo.fr/), my engineering school in France.

## 🎯 Purpose

The website documents my time living in the Netherlands during my international mobility.
It highlights key aspects of the experience, such as:

* Cultural immersion 🇳🇱
* Daily life and adaptation as a French intern 🇫🇷
* Personal growth and international perspective 🌍

It’s not a technical project or collaborative repo — just a personal blog, written primarily for academic purposes but shared publicly in the spirit of openness.
