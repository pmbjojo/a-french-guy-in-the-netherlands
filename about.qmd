Hello, my name is Joshua, I am 23 years old and I am an apprentice engineer at the ESEO in Angers. I finished my 3 years of collaboration with the company SDEL Contr√¥le Commande in May to do my internship abroad. The aim of this blog is to allow you to follow my experience for 3 months in the Netherlands. 

I joined the software development team of the Kropman company for the summer period. This blog will allow me to share my feelings as well as my professional and extra-professional experiences. Thank you for your support and enjoy your discovery.
