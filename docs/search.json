    "text": "Hello folks, today I will introduce you to my accommodation. First of all, I would like to thank Jan, my host for his warm welcome. I was very well received and I already feel at home. I met Jan in France, he is a friend of Christine, a close family member. He spent the beginning of the summer in Bretteville, the village where my parents live. We were able to organize a meeting to get to know each other. He was the one who recommended me to one of his friends for my internship at Kropman. He also offered me to stay at his house during this period. Jan is in France until mid-July, so I am alone in the house for the moment.\n\n\nThe house is part of the village of Vianen. The village has less than 2000 inhabitants. It is a very quiet and peaceful place. It is a typical Dutch house, with a sloping roof and red bricks. It is very spacious and bright. I have a bedroom with a double bed. The bathroom has a bathtub and a shower. The kitchen is large and well equipped. The living room is warm with a sofa and a television. There is a garden with a terrace where I can relax after work. It is a rare opportunity to be able to enjoy such comfort during my internship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe house is about a 20-minute drive from my workplace. I have to take the highway to get there. It is a moderately busy road at the moment because it is also the summer holiday period in the Netherlands. Usually there are no traffic jams in the morning but in the evening it is a bit crowded. I came to the Netherlands by car so that I don’t have to take public transport to get to work. This saves me time and I don’t have to be tied to timetables.\nI am very happy with my accommodation and I feel very good here. Thank you for reading and I’ll see you soon for new articles."

    "text": "Hello everyone, today I want to share with you the story of my departure from France and my one-day car trip to the Netherlands.\nFor those who don’t know me, I invite you to consult my profile.\nI just finished what may be the last period of classes of my life last Friday. No time to rest since D-Day has arrived. This morning I set off for the Netherlands.\n\n\n\n\nI left around 10:30 and my journey lasted almost 10 hours. The first part of the trip went smoothly. The Normandy roads are familiar. I stopped in the Rouen region to eat in a fast food restaurant. Rouen is a big city and its industrial outskirts are not really pleasant.\nI quickly got back on the road towards Lille. I was not used to the architecture of the north and seeing so many red brick buildings surprised me a little. It is an architecture that I find very pretty and that gives a certain charm to the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossing the French-Belgian border, the road signs changed, the names of the cities became different, and I really realized that I am leaving France for good. On this part of the journey, I was listening to the radio to follow the results of the legislative elections in France. It was complicated because most of the radios were in Flemish. I did not think that Belgium was so linguistically divided.\nCrossing Belgium is an experience in itself. Belgian highways are known for their variable quality. Finally, I reached the Dutch border. The transition is subtle but noticeable: the roads are impeccable, the cycle paths are omnipresent, and the organization of the cities and the countryside is impressive.\nThe last part of the journey took me to my final destination, the place where I will live and work for the next 3 months. Fatigue is making itself felt. When I arrived around 9 pm, Kiki, the daughter of the owner of the accommodation, was there to welcome me. She was very kind and welcoming and she showed me around.\nHopefully, I start my internship on Tuesday so I have a day to rest and discover the city. I’ll save this part of the trip for future posts. Thank you for following me, see you soon."

    "text": "The European Football Championship started on June 14 and will end today. I like to watch football and I have been following the competition since the beginning. The tournament is held every 4 years and brings together the best European teams. This year, the competition is taking place in Germany.\nThe French team is not doing very well this year. They were eliminated in the quarterfinals by the Spanish team. The French team was one of the favorites to win the competition, but they were not able to perform at their best. The Spanish team played a great game and won 2-0. It was a disappointing result for the French fans, who were hoping for a better performance from their team.\nI’ve had the opportunity to watch some of the games with my colleagues from Kropman. They are not big football fans but they have been following the dutch team closely. Jason invited the whole team to his place. We watched the game opposing the Netherlands to Romania. The Dutch team played a great game and won 3-0. The atmosphere was great and we continued by watching the game between Austria and Turkey. It was a nice experience, we joined him for dinner just after work and we ordered some African food. It’s a bit weird because here the order of aperitif and dinner is reversed. We started with the main course and then we had a drink and aperitif cakes.\nAfter the defeat of France, some of my colleagues were making a lot of fun of me. They were teasing me and saying that the French team was not fun to watch but I had my revenge the next day. The Dutch team was eliminated by the English team. It’s a shame because I would have liked to have been able to enjoy the atmosphere here a little longer.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary, the French team did not played well football but I’ve had a good time with peoples here during a few weeks. We can say that the best team won the competition they were above everyone. Thanks for reading, see you soon."

    "text": "Kropman is a company that specializes in the installation and maintenance of technical installations in buildings. The company is located in Nijmegen, a city in the east of the Netherlands. The company has several branches in the Netherlands and employs more than 800 people. Kropman was acquired by the French group Eiffage in 2018.\nhttps://www.eiffage.com/en/media/news/eiffage-accelerates-its-development-in-europe-in-energy-with-the-acquisition-of-the-kropman-group-in-the-netherlands\n\n\n\n\n\nKropman headquarters is located in the industrial periphery of Nijmegen. The building is composed of 2 areas, one in red brick and the other more recent is covered in sheet metal. The building is modern and well maintained. The parking lot is spacious and there are charging stations for electric cars.\nI am doing my internship in the software development team. The team is composed of 8 people. Gert-Jan is the team leader and he will be my tutor during my internship. We work in an open space with individual desks and the office is spacious and bright.\nThe atmosphere is relaxed and the team is very friendly. They are very welcoming and they are always ready to help. From time to time they send each other plastic ducks to disturb each others or ask for help. Dutch people are very direct and they don’t hesitate to say what they think.\nEvery member of the team is Dutch except for me. Everyone speaks English and they are very good at it. They are so used to it that sometimes they speak English to each other even if I am not there. It is normal for them and sometimes easier to switch languages.\nThe common working hours are from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm. The team has a flexible schedule, so I can arrive and leave when I want as long as I work 8 hours a day. Usually, I arrive at 9:00 am and leave at 5:00 pm.\nFor lunch we usually eat at our desk. Everyone brings their own lunch. The team doesn’t go out to eat and there is no canteen in the building. The company doesn’t provide a subsidy for lunch. The team has a tradition of ordering food on Friday. They switch between multiple restaurants. This Friday I tried a two typical Dutch dish called “kroket” and “frikandel”. They are fried snacks that are usually eaten with bread.\nI am very happy to be part of this team and I am looking forward to learning a lot from them. I will keep you informed of my progress in future articles. Thank you for reading."

    "title": "The city of Nijmegen",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Nestled in the eastern part of the Netherlands, Nijmegen is a city steeped in history, culture, and vibrant life. Often overshadowed by its more famous counterparts like Amsterdam and Rotterdam, Nijmegen offers a unique charm that is well worth exploring. From its ancient roots to its modern-day allure, here’s a deep dive into what makes Nijmegen a hidden gem.\nNijmegen proudly holds the title of the oldest city in the Netherlands. Its history dates back over 2,000 years to when it was a Roman military camp known as Noviomagus. The city’s strategic location along the Waal River made it an important settlement for trade and military purposes. As you wander through the city, remnants of its Roman past can still be found, including sections of the ancient city wall and archaeological finds displayed in local museums.\n\n\nThe city is surrounded by lush parks, forests, and nature reserves. The cityscape of Nijmegen is a fascinating blend of old and new. The medieval St. Steven’s Church (Stevenskerk), with its towering Gothic architecture, is a testament to the city’s rich historical tapestry. Climb the church tower for a panoramic view of the city and the surrounding countryside. Another must-see is the Valkhof Museum, situated on the site of a former Roman fortress, showcasing artifacts that tell the story of Nijmegen’s past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first Monday after I arrived in the Netherlands, I went to register for a BSN (Burger Service Nummer) at the city hall. The process was quick, and the staff were friendly and helpful. The BSN was required for Kropman to process my internship contract. After completing the registration, I took the opportunity to wander around the city center.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was amazed by the beauty of the old buildings and the charm of the cobblestone streets. The city center is vibrant and bustling, with a mix of shops, cafes, and historic landmarks. I spent the afternoon wandering through the streets, taking in the sights and sounds of this enchanting city.\nDutch gastronomy is a reflection of the country’s rich history and its openness to global influences. Traditional Dutch cuisine, known for its hearty and straightforward dishes such as stamppot (mashed potatoes with vegetables), bitterballen (fried meatballs), and herring, offers a comforting and rustic dining experience. However, the Netherlands, and Nijmegen in particular, has embraced a vibrant multicultural culinary landscape. This diversity in food options is largely due to the country’s history of trade, colonization, and immigration. As a result, the Dutch have developed a taste for international flavors, leading to a flourishing scene of foreign restaurants.\nOne interesting cultural difference that stands out is the typical dinner time in the Netherlands compared to France. In the Netherlands, dinner is usually eaten earlier, with most families sitting down to eat between 5:30 PM and 7:00 PM. This early dinner time aligns with the country’s rhythm of starting the day early and winding down sooner in the evening.\n\n\nNestled near a charming park, Indian Way offers a delightful escape into the flavors of India. This small yet vibrant restaurant is known for its warm ambiance and authentic Indian cuisine. Whether you’re a fan of spicy curries, savory biryanis, or the rich, creamy taste of butter chicken, Indian Way delivers a culinary experience that transports your taste buds straight to the heart of India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those with a penchant for variety, Orient Plaza offers a unique dining experience that spans the breadth of Asian cuisine. This large, bustling food court-style establishment features numerous stalls and restaurants, each specializing in different Asian dishes. From sushi and dim sum to Thai curries and Korean BBQ, Orient Plaza is a paradise for food lovers looking to explore a diverse range of flavors in one place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lively atmosphere, with its vibrant decor and the hum of diners enjoying their meals, makes Orient Plaza a popular choice for group outings and casual dining. Whether you’re in the mood for a quick bite or a leisurely feast, you’ll find something to satisfy your cravings here."
