    "text": "As of August 23rd, I officially wrapped up my three-month internship in the Netherlands and began the journey back to France.\nReflecting on my time in the Netherlands, The internship was not only a professional milestone but also a deeply enriching personal journey. From navigating a new culture to tackling complex projects, every moment has contributed to a significant period of growth.\nDuring my time here, I saw notable improvements in my English language skills, gaining both confidence and fluency. Professionally, I expanded my technical expertise by learning C# and working with the .NET platform, which has added valuable skills to my programming toolkit.\nAs a gesture of appreciation, Kropman gifted me a poster and a T-shirt, both of which will be cherished mementos of my time with the company. Additionally, I was thrilled to receive a job offer from Kropman, a testament to the positive impact of my work and the meaningful connections made during the internship.\nOne of the most rewarding aspects of this internship was the chance to meet and work with amazing people. Each person I interacted with contributed to a rich environment that made my experience truly amazing.\nA heartfelt thank you goes to Jan, my host during this internship. Jan’s support and friendship were invaluable, and I am grateful for his guidance and hospitality. He will remain a close friend, and I look forward to staying connected in the future.\nAs I conclude this chapter and head back to France, it’s been an incredible experience, marked by personal growth, professional development, and unforgettable memories."

    "text": "During my three-month internship as a software developer in the Netherlands, I had the opportunity to dive deep into two significant projects.\nInitially, I focused on smaller tasks, which were essential in understanding the team’s workflow and the development environment. These early assignments were a great way to familiarize myself with the codebase and the team’s expectations, laying a solid foundation for the more complex projects that followed.\nOne of the major projects I tackled was the rework of the Request Tool application. This tool manages requests through a multi-step approval process, involving several stakeholders:\n\nRequestor: Initiates the request.\nManager, Coordinator and Director: Approve or reject the request.\nStorekeeper and Buyer: Handle the purchasing process.\n\n\nTo modernize the application, I revamped both the logic and data layers. This extensive update required running database migrations using Entity Framework. Given the scope of the changes, I also wrote raw SQL queries to ensure that the application’s core functionality remained intact and efficient.\nOne of the key enhancements I introduced was a timeline feature for each request. This timeline allows users to easily track the current step and view the progression of the request through its various stages. By providing a visual representation of the request’s journey, this feature adds clarity and helps stakeholders stay informed about the status of their requests.\n\nAnother significant project was developing the Signoff List application, which needed to have an Eiffage theme to ensure it could be shared across various companies within the group, including those beyond my own company, Kropman. The application was designed to streamline the signoff process and featured:\n\nDocument URL or SharePoint Link: Allows users to easily link to relevant documents or resources.\nDeadlines and Approvals: Tracks deadlines and manages approval statuses.\nGroup Handling: Simplifies the creation and reuse of signoff groups to enhance efficiency.\n\n\nI started with Bootstrap for the design but later transitioned to MudBlazor for a more refined and user-friendly interface. MudBlazor’s components offered a cleaner, more modern look and improved usability, making the application more accessible and visually appealing.\nAs I look back on these projects, I’m grateful for the opportunity to contribute meaningfully and develop solutions that enhance efficiency and usability. This experience has been invaluable, and I’m excited to apply the skills and insights gained to future projects."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Nestled in the eastern part of the Netherlands, Nijmegen is a city steeped in history, culture, and vibrant life. Often overshadowed by its more famous counterparts like Amsterdam and Rotterdam, Nijmegen offers a unique charm that is well worth exploring. From its ancient roots to its modern-day allure, here’s a deep dive into what makes Nijmegen a hidden gem.\nNijmegen proudly holds the title of the oldest city in the Netherlands. Its history dates back over 2,000 years to when it was a Roman military camp known as Noviomagus. The city’s strategic location along the Waal River made it an important settlement for trade and military purposes. As you wander through the city, remnants of its Roman past can still be found, including sections of the ancient city wall and archaeological finds displayed in local museums.\n\n\nThe city is surrounded by lush parks, forests, and nature reserves. The cityscape of Nijmegen is a fascinating blend of old and new. The medieval St. Steven’s Church (Stevenskerk), with its towering Gothic architecture, is a testament to the city’s rich historical tapestry. Climb the church tower for a panoramic view of the city and the surrounding countryside. Another must-see is the Valkhof Museum, situated on the site of a former Roman fortress, showcasing artifacts that tell the story of Nijmegen’s past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first Monday after I arrived in the Netherlands, I went to register for a BSN (Burger Service Nummer) at the city hall. The process was quick, and the staff were friendly and helpful. The BSN was required for Kropman to process my internship contract. After completing the registration, I took the opportunity to wander around the city center.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was amazed by the beauty of the old buildings and the charm of the cobblestone streets. The city center is vibrant and bustling, with a mix of shops, cafes, and historic landmarks. I spent the afternoon wandering through the streets, taking in the sights and sounds of this enchanting city.\nDutch gastronomy is a reflection of the country’s rich history and its openness to global influences. Traditional Dutch cuisine, known for its hearty and straightforward dishes such as stamppot (mashed potatoes with vegetables), bitterballen (fried meatballs), and herring, offers a comforting and rustic dining experience. However, the Netherlands, and Nijmegen in particular, has embraced a vibrant multicultural culinary landscape. This diversity in food options is largely due to the country’s history of trade, colonization, and immigration. As a result, the Dutch have developed a taste for international flavors, leading to a flourishing scene of foreign restaurants.\nOne interesting cultural difference that stands out is the typical dinner time in the Netherlands compared to France. In the Netherlands, dinner is usually eaten earlier, with most families sitting down to eat between 5:30 PM and 7:00 PM. This early dinner time aligns with the country’s rhythm of starting the day early and winding down sooner in the evening.\n\n\nNestled near a charming park, Indian Way offers a delightful escape into the flavors of India. This small yet vibrant restaurant is known for its warm ambiance and authentic Indian cuisine. Whether you’re a fan of spicy curries, savory biryanis, or the rich, creamy taste of butter chicken, Indian Way delivers a culinary experience that transports your taste buds straight to the heart of India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those with a penchant for variety, Orient Plaza offers a unique dining experience that spans the breadth of Asian cuisine. This large, bustling food court-style establishment features numerous stalls and restaurants, each specializing in different Asian dishes. From sushi and dim sum to Thai curries and Korean BBQ, Orient Plaza is a paradise for food lovers looking to explore a diverse range of flavors in one place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lively atmosphere, with its vibrant decor and the hum of diners enjoying their meals, makes Orient Plaza a popular choice for group outings and casual dining. Whether you’re in the mood for a quick bite or a leisurely feast, you’ll find something to satisfy your cravings here."

    "text": "Kropman is a company that specializes in the installation and maintenance of technical installations in buildings. The company is located in Nijmegen, a city in the east of the Netherlands. The company has several branches in the Netherlands and employs more than 800 people. Kropman was acquired by the French group Eiffage in 2018.\nhttps://www.eiffage.com/en/media/news/eiffage-accelerates-its-development-in-europe-in-energy-with-the-acquisition-of-the-kropman-group-in-the-netherlands\n\n\n\n\n\nKropman headquarters is located in the industrial periphery of Nijmegen. The building is composed of 2 areas, one in red brick and the other more recent is covered in sheet metal. The building is modern and well maintained. The parking lot is spacious and there are charging stations for electric cars.\nI am doing my internship in the software development team. The team is composed of 8 people. Gert-Jan is the team leader and he will be my tutor during my internship. We work in an open space with individual desks and the office is spacious and bright.\nThe atmosphere is relaxed and the team is very friendly. They are very welcoming and they are always ready to help. From time to time they send each other plastic ducks to disturb each others or ask for help. Dutch people are very direct and they don’t hesitate to say what they think.\nEvery member of the team is Dutch except for me. Everyone speaks English and they are very good at it. They are so used to it that sometimes they speak English to each other even if I am not there. It is normal for them and sometimes easier to switch languages.\nThe common working hours are from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm. The team has a flexible schedule, so I can arrive and leave when I want as long as I work 8 hours a day. Usually, I arrive at 9:00 am and leave at 5:00 pm.\nFor lunch we usually eat at our desk. Everyone brings their own lunch. The team doesn’t go out to eat and there is no canteen in the building. The company doesn’t provide a subsidy for lunch. The team has a tradition of ordering food on Friday. They switch between multiple restaurants. This Friday I tried a two typical Dutch dish called “kroket” and “frikandel”. They are fried snacks that are usually eaten with bread.\nI am very happy to be part of this team and I am looking forward to learning a lot from them. I will keep you informed of my progress in future articles. Thank you for reading."

The tournament is held every 4 years and brings together the best European teams. This year, the competition is taking place in Germany.\nThe French team is not doing very well this year. They were eliminated in the quarterfinals by the Spanish team. The French team was one of the favorites to win the competition, but they were not able to perform at their best. The Spanish team played a great game and won 2-0. It was a disappointing result for the French fans, who were hoping for a better performance from their team.\nI’ve had the opportunity to watch some of the games with my colleagues from Kropman. They are not big football fans but they have been following the dutch team closely. Jason invited the whole team to his place. We watched the game opposing the Netherlands to Romania. The Dutch team played a great game and won 3-0. The atmosphere was great and we continued by watching the game between Austria and Turkey. It was a nice experience, we joined him for dinner just after work and we ordered some African food. It’s a bit weird because here the order of aperitif and dinner is reversed. We started with the main course and then we had a drink and aperitif cakes.\nAfter the defeat of France, some of my colleagues were making a lot of fun of me. They were teasing me and saying that the French team was not fun to watch but I had my revenge the next day. The Dutch team was eliminated by the English team. It’s a shame because I would have liked to have been able to enjoy the atmosphere here a little longer.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary, the French team did not played well football but I’ve had a good time with peoples here during a few weeks. We can say that the best team won the competition they were above everyone. Thanks for reading, see you soon."

    "text": "Now that it has been a few weeks since I started my internship, I have a good idea of what my daily routine looks like. I thought I would share it with you.\nI usually start my day at 9am. I take the time to check my emails and to plan my day. Usually, I work on a single project, so I know what I have to do. I usually work on a feature or a bug fix. I take the time to understand the requirements. Then, I start coding and finally before pushing my code, I test it.\nThe members team eats at any time after 12pm. We don’t have a cafeteria in the office, so we stay at our desk. Here, this is not really a discussion time, everyone just eats on his side. On Friday we always order lunch from a restaurant nearby. Delivery services are very developed in the Netherlands, it’s impressive. You can order anything at any time from a restaurant or a supermarket.\nI leave the office around 5:30pm. Usually staff need to close the office at 6pm. It’s weird from my perspective because in France, I used to leave the office around 7pm sometimes. But here, people come earlier and leave around 4:30pm. It’s a cultural difference that I have to get used to. I think it’s a good thing because it allows me to have a good work-life balance.\nI usually go back to my accommodation directly after work. Sometimes we take aperitif with my host. Afterwards I chill out watching TV or playing video games. I also take the time to call my family and friends in France. I’m really happy to have found a good place to live. It’s a bit far from the office, but it’s a nice neighborhood. I’m really enjoying my time here in the Netherlands. I’m looking forward to discovering more about this country and its people."

I met new people, it was quite easy, the Dutch are very direct which is really welcome as an intern.\nWe kicked off the festivities right after work at around 5 PM, and the fun continued well into the night, wrapping up around midnight.

The softwares are used to manage the company’s projects, to manage the maintenance of the installations and to manage the company’s resources in addition to the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) features.\nThe team uses the Agile methodology to manage the development of the softwares. Each developer maintain it’s own backlog and the team meets every end of the day to discuss the progress of the tasks and to plan the work for next day.\nThe team has a great CI/CD pipeline that allows to deploy the softwares quickly and safely. The team uses Azure DevOps to manage the source code, the backlog and the deployment pipelines of each project.\nAll the applications are developed in C# with the .NET framework. The team uses the the ASP.NET framework with Blazor and Entity Framework to develop the web applications.\nC# is a great language to develop applications because it is a strongly typed language. The .NET framework is a great framework because it is a mature framework with batteries included. It is maintained by Microsoft and it is a great framework to develop enterprise applications. Blazor allows to develop web applications with C# and to share the code between the client and the server. And Entity Framework is an ORM that allows to interact with the database easily within the C# code.\nBefore this internship, I had never worked with those technologies. I already had a background in web applications development with JavaScript in my previous experience. I took an online training during my first week to learn the basics. After this I started working on small tasks to learn how the applications are developed in the company.\nThis may all be gibberish to you so here is an example of an application I have been working on so far.\n\nThe contact application is used to manage the company’s contacts. It allows to search for collaborators and display basic informations. For this application I fixed a performance issue and I added a new feature.\nThe application was really slow sometimes because it needs to render a lot of contacts. Blazor uses a components model to display elements. The issue here was when you search for a contact, the application was rendering only the filtered contacts, this cause a lot of overhead because the difference between two states is huge and the rendering was slow. I fixed this by always rendering every contacts and hidden the contacts that are not in the search results with css.\nThis application display the status of employees at the time. The status can be absent, busy or available. The application was lacking the date and time of the comeback of the absent and busy employees. The application already had access of the teams calendar and the calendars from the ERP system. I added a new feature that allows to display the date and time of the comeback of the absent and busy employees. Due to GPRD I had to make sure that the date and time of the comeback didn’t leak any personal information (sick leave, vacation, …). To face this I’ve chosen to display only the date and time of comeback only for the current day. This feature is really useful because it allows to know when a collaborator will be back and to plan the work accordingly.\nThank you once again for reading my blog. See you next week!"

    "text": "Hello everyone, today I want to share with you the story of my departure from France and my one-day car trip to the Netherlands.\nFor those who don’t know me, I invite you to consult my profile.\nI just finished what may be the last period of classes of my life last Friday. No time to rest since D-Day has arrived. This morning I set off for the Netherlands.\n\n\n\n\nI left around 10:30 and my journey lasted almost 10 hours. The first part of the trip went smoothly. The Normandy roads are familiar. I stopped in the Rouen region to eat in a fast food restaurant. Rouen is a big city and its industrial outskirts are not really pleasant.\nI quickly got back on the road towards Lille. I was not used to the architecture of the north and seeing so many red brick buildings surprised me a little. It is an architecture that I find very pretty and that gives a certain charm to the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossing the French-Belgian border, the road signs changed, the names of the cities became different, and I really realized that I am leaving France for good. On this part of the journey, I was listening to the radio to follow the results of the legislative elections in France. It was complicated because most of the radios were in Flemish. I did not think that Belgium was so linguistically divided.\nCrossing Belgium is an experience in itself. Belgian highways are known for their variable quality. Finally, I reached the Dutch border. The transition is subtle but noticeable: the roads are impeccable, the cycle paths are omnipresent, and the organization of the cities and the countryside is impressive.\nThe last part of the journey took me to my final destination, the place where I will live and work for the next 3 months. Fatigue is making itself felt. When I arrived around 9 pm, Kiki, the daughter of the owner of the accommodation, was there to welcome me. She was very kind and welcoming and she showed me around.\nHopefully, I start my internship on Tuesday so I have a day to rest and discover the city. I’ll save this part of the trip for future posts. Thank you for following me, see you soon."

We were able to organize a meeting to get to know each other. He was the one who recommended me to one of his friends for my internship at Kropman. He also offered me to stay at his house during this period. Jan is in France until mid-July, so I am alone in the house for the moment.\n\n\nThe house is part of the village of Vianen. The village has less than 2000 inhabitants. It is a very quiet and peaceful place. It is a typical Dutch house, with a sloping roof and red bricks. It is very spacious and bright. I have a bedroom with a double bed. The bathroom has a bathtub and a shower. The kitchen is large and well equipped. The living room is warm with a sofa and a television. There is a garden with a terrace where I can relax after work. It is a rare opportunity to be able to enjoy such comfort during my internship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe house is about a 20-minute drive from my workplace. I have to take the highway to get there. It is a moderately busy road at the moment because it is also the summer holiday period in the Netherlands. Usually there are no traffic jams in the morning but in the evening it is a bit crowded. I came to the Netherlands by car so that I don’t have to take public transport to get to work. This saves me time and I don’t have to be tied to timetables.\nI am very happy with my accommodation and I feel very good here. Thank you for reading and I’ll see you soon for new articles."

    "text": "Last weekend, I set out on an bike ride through Nijmegen, the city is renowned for its scenic beauty and rich history. The journey took me from Vianen through a forest trail.\nThe ride began with a route through the forest, stretching approximately 18 kilometers from Vianen. During the ride, I had the chance to visit some fascinating historical sites.\nOne notable stop was the home of the oldest beermakers in Nijmegen, or perhaps even the Netherlands. Although I couldn’t quite recall the exact details, the historic significance of the place added an intriguing layer to the journey.\nNijmegen is also home to some beautiful parks and historical sites. Valkhof Park features the remains of the medieval Valkhof Chapel, which offers stunning views of the city and the Rhine River. Another notable stop was Kronenburgerpark, where I came across the impressive Kronenburger Tower. This historic tower, part of Nijmegen’s old city walls, stands as a testament to the city’s medieval past.\nI encountered an unexpected urban challenge. Nijmegen (maybe it the case in every dutch city), has a significant issue with bike parking. At various points throughout the city, I observed clusters of bikes parked haphazardly, sometimes resembling a makeshift waste disposal site. The sheer number of bikes, often crammed together in crowded areas, was overwhelming and created an impression of disorder.\n\nI highly recommend taking the time to explore Nijmegen by bike. It’s a fantastic way to appreciate both the natural beauty and historical significance of the city."
