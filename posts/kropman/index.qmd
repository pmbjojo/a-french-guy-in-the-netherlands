Kropman is a company that specializes in the installation and maintenance of technical installations in buildings. The company is located in Nijmegen, a city in the east of the Netherlands. The company has several branches in the Netherlands and employs more than 800 people. Kropman was acquired by the French group Eiffage in 2018.

Kropman headquarters is located in the industrial periphery of Nijmegen. The building is composed of 2 areas, one in red brick and the other more recent is covered in sheet metal. The building is modern and well maintained. The parking lot is spacious and there are charging stations for electric cars.

I am doing my internship in the software development team. The team is composed of 8 people. Gert-Jan is the team leader and he will be my tutor during my internship. We work in an open space with individual desks and the office is spacious and bright. 

The atmosphere is relaxed and the team is very friendly. They are very welcoming and they are always ready to help. From time to time they send each other plastic ducks to disturb each others or ask for help. Dutch people are very direct and they don't hesitate to say what they think.

Every member of the team is Dutch except for me. Everyone speaks English and they are very good at it. They are so used to it that sometimes they speak English to each other even if I am not there. It is normal for them and sometimes easier to switch languages.

The common working hours are from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm. The team has a flexible schedule, so I can arrive and leave when I want as long as I work 8 hours a day. Usually, I arrive at 9:00 am and leave at 5:00 pm.

For lunch we usually eat at our desk. Everyone brings their own lunch. The team doesn't go out to eat and there is no canteen in the building. The company doesn't provide a subsidy for lunch. The team has a tradition of ordering food on Friday. They switch between multiple restaurants. This Friday I tried a two typical Dutch dish called "kroket" and "frikandel". They are fried snacks that are usually eaten with bread. 

I am very happy to be part of this team and I am looking forward to learning a lot from them. I will keep you informed of my progress in future articles. Thank you for reading.
