Hello everyone, today I want to share with you the story of my departure from France and my one-day car trip to the Netherlands.

For those who don't know me, I invite you to consult my [profile](/about.html).

I just finished what may be the last period of classes of my life last Friday. No time to rest since D-Day has arrived. This morning I set off for the Netherlands.

I left around 10:30 and my journey lasted almost 10 hours. The first part of the trip went smoothly. The Normandy roads are familiar. I stopped in the Rouen region to eat in a fast food restaurant. Rouen is a big city and its industrial outskirts are not really pleasant.

I quickly got back on the road towards Lille. I was not used to the architecture of the north and seeing so many red brick buildings surprised me a little. It is an architecture that I find very pretty and that gives a certain charm to the region.

Crossing the French-Belgian border, the road signs changed, the names of the cities became different, and I really realized that I am leaving France for good. On this part of the journey, I was listening to the radio to follow the results of the legislative elections in France. It was complicated because most of the radios were in Flemish. I did not think that Belgium was so linguistically divided.

Crossing Belgium is an experience in itself. Belgian highways are known for their variable quality. Finally, I reached the Dutch border. The transition is subtle but noticeable: the roads are impeccable, the cycle paths are omnipresent, and the organization of the cities and the countryside is impressive.

The last part of the journey took me to my final destination, the place where I will live and work for the next 3 months. Fatigue is making itself felt. When I arrived around 9 pm, Kiki, the daughter of the owner of the accommodation, was there to welcome me. She was very kind and welcoming and she showed me around.

Hopefully, I start my internship on Tuesday so I have a day to rest and discover the city. I'll save this part of the trip for future posts. Thank you for following me, see you soon.
