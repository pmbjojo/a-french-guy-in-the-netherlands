Last weekend, I set out on an bike ride through Nijmegen, the city is renowned for its scenic beauty and rich history. The journey took me from Vianen through a forest trail.

The ride began with a route through the forest, stretching approximately 18 kilometers from Vianen. During the ride, I had the chance to visit some fascinating historical sites. 

One notable stop was the home of the oldest beermakers in Nijmegen, or perhaps even the Netherlands. Although I couldn’t quite recall the exact details, the historic significance of the place added an intriguing layer to the journey. 

Nijmegen is also home to some beautiful parks and historical sites. Valkhof Park features the remains of the medieval Valkhof Chapel, which offers stunning views of the city and the Rhine River. Another notable stop was Kronenburgerpark, where I came across the impressive Kronenburger Tower. This historic tower, part of Nijmegen’s old city walls, stands as a testament to the city’s medieval past.

I encountered an unexpected urban challenge. Nijmegen (maybe it the case in every dutch city), has a significant issue with bike parking. At various points throughout the city, I observed clusters of bikes parked haphazardly, sometimes resembling a makeshift waste disposal site. The sheer number of bikes, often crammed together in crowded areas, was overwhelming and created an impression of disorder.

I highly recommend taking the time to explore Nijmegen by bike. It’s a fantastic way to appreciate both the natural beauty and historical significance of the city.
