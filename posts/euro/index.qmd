The European Football Championship started on June 14 and will end today. I like to watch football and I have been following the competition since the beginning. The tournament is held every 4 years and brings together the best European teams. This year, the competition is taking place in Germany. 

The French team is not doing very well this year. They were eliminated in the quarterfinals by the Spanish team. The French team was one of the favorites to win the competition, but they were not able to perform at their best. The Spanish team played a great game and won 2-0. It was a disappointing result for the French fans, who were hoping for a better performance from their team. 

I've had the opportunity to watch some of the games with my colleagues from Kropman. They are not big football fans but they have been following the dutch team closely. Jason invited the whole team to his place. We watched the game opposing the Netherlands to Romania. The Dutch team played a great game and won 3-0. The atmosphere was great and we continued by watching the game between Austria and Turkey. It was a nice experience, we joined him for dinner just after work and we ordered some African food. It's a bit weird because here the order of aperitif and dinner is reversed. We started with the main course and then we had a drink and aperitif cakes.

After the defeat of France, some of my colleagues were making a lot of fun of me. They were teasing me and saying that the French team was not fun to watch but I had my revenge the next day. The Dutch team was eliminated by the English team. It's a shame because I would have liked to have been able to enjoy the atmosphere here a little longer.

Summary, the French team did not played well football but I've had a good time with peoples here during a few weeks. We can say that the best team won the competition they were above everyone. Thanks for reading, see you soon.
